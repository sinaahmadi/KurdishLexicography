# Kurdish Lexicographical Resources

This repository contains four dictionaries as follows:

- Sorani (5,527 headwords)
- Kurmanji (4,053 headwords)
- Hawrami (1,170 headwords)
- ðŸ†• Southern Kurdish (11,026 headwords)

The three first dictionaries were created in the [KurdishLex](https://github.com/KurdishBLARK/KurdishLex) project in 2019. Please check [this paper](https://sinaahmadi.github.io/docs/articles/ahmadi2019kurdishlex.pdf) for more information and proper citation.

More recently, we further completed this project by creating a dictionary for the [Southern varieties of Kurdish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Kurdish) spoken mainly in the regions of Kermanshah, Ilam and Lorestan. The lexicographic content is graciously provided by Ako Jalilian who compiled the BaÅŸÃ»r Dictionary.

You can process this data using any ontology editor or framework, such as [ProgtÃ©gÃ©](https://protege.stanford.edu) and [GraphDB](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/).
